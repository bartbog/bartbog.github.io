                    <h1>Origin puzzle</h1>
					<p>This puzzle, taken from the book "Puzzle Baronâ€™s logic puzzles" concerns people's state of origin, current city of domicile, and age. The clues are:
<ul>
<li>Mattie is 113 years old,</li>
                        <li>The person who lives in Tehama is a native of either Kansas or Oregon",</li>
                        <li>The Washington native is 1 year older than Ernesto",</li>
                        <li>Roxanne is 2 years younger than the Kansas native",</li>

                        <li>Of the person who lives in Tehama and Mattie, one is a native of Alaska and the other is from Kansas.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The input of our system consists of these clues, combined with the following lexicon (the automated lexicon building does not yet work fully automatically):</p>

<h2>IDP code </h2>
<p>Our tool then generates the following translation of each of the clues in the IDP language (where ! is a universal quantifier, ? is an existential quantifier, &amp; is conjunction, | is disjunction and ~ is negation )</p>
